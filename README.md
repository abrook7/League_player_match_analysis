## League_player_match_analysis
This repo contains the files I used to conduct my analysis of my league of legends matches by using an ETL to extract data from Riot's API.
There are two Python files which were used extracted data from Riot's API, transformed the JSON into a pandas dataframe, and Loaded the 
information into an Amazon MySQL RDS micro instance. The data was then analyzed and visualized using MySQL to query specific information and 
Tableau to build out a dashboard which can be accessed in the chrome_proxy.exe file or at the link here:
